# Plan Limit Enforcement Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive plan limit enforcement for free users. The system now disables all receipt-related actions when users reach their monthly limit (5 receipts for free users), providing clear visual feedback and upgrade prompts.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Action Disabling When Limit Reached**

#### ✅ **Create Receipt Button**
- **Location**: Header and empty state
- **Behavior**: Disabled when limit reached
- **Visual**: Grayed out with "Limit Reached" text
- **Tooltip**: "Monthly limit reached. Upgrade to create more receipts."

#### ✅ **Edit Receipt Button**
- **Location**: Each receipt card
- **Behavior**: Disabled when limit reached
- **Visual**: Grayed out with reduced opacity
- **Tooltip**: "Monthly limit reached. Upgrade to edit receipts."

#### ✅ **Download Receipt Button**
- **Location**: Each receipt card
- **Behavior**: Disabled when limit reached
- **Visual**: Grayed out with reduced opacity
- **Tooltip**: "Monthly limit reached. Upgrade to download receipts."

#### ✅ **Receipt Form**
- **Location**: Create/Edit form
- **Behavior**: Submit button disabled when limit reached
- **Visual**: Grayed out with "Limit Reached" text
- **Validation**: Prevents form submission with alert

### 2. **Visual Feedback System**

#### ✅ **Header Indicator**
- **Display**: Shows "• Monthly limit reached" in red when limit hit
- **Location**: Next to plan information
- **Style**: Red text with medium font weight

#### ✅ **Warning Banner**
- **Display**: Prominent red banner when limit reached
- **Content**: 
  - Clear explanation of limit

- **Tooltips**: Clear explanations for disabled state

### 3. **No Reset on Deletion**

#### ✅ **Usage Tracking**
- **Increment Only**: Monthly usage only increases on creation
- **No Decrease**: Deleting receipts doesn't reduce monthly count
- **Persistent**: Count remains until month reset or upgrade

### 4. **Reset Conditions**

#### ✅ **Monthly Reset**
- **Automatic**: New month automatically resets usage
- **Date-based**: Uses current year/month for tracking
- **Seamless**: No user action required

#### ✅ **Upgrade Reset**
- **Webhook Integration**: Resets usage when subscription becomes active
- **Triggers**: 
  - `checkout.session.completed` with active/trialing status
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` when subscription becomes active
- **Immediate**: Users get fresh start when upgrading

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Utility Functions**

#### `lib/subscription/check.ts`
```typescript
export function hasReachedMonthlyLimit(team: Team | null, currentReceiptCount: number): boolean
export function shouldBlockActions(team: Team | null, currentReceiptCount: number): boolean
```

### 2. **Component Updates**

#### **Receipts Page** (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/receipts/page.tsx`)
- **Limit Checking**: Uses `shouldBlockActions()` to determine disabled state
- **Button States**: All action buttons respect limit status
- **Warning Banner**: Conditional display based on limit status
- **Header Updates**: Shows limit status in plan information

#### **Receipt Form** (`components/receipt-form.tsx`)
- **Disabled Prop**: Accepts `disabled` prop for limit enforcement
- **Submit Prevention**: Blocks form submission when disabled
- **Button States**: Submit button shows "Limit Reached" when disabled

#### **Download Button** (`components/download-button.tsx`)
- **Disabled Prop**: Accepts `disabled` prop for limit enforcement
- **Download Prevention**: Blocks downloads when disabled
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear disabled state styling

### 3. **API Integration**

#### **Usage API** (`app/api/usage/route.ts`)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/usage`
- **Purpose**: Provides current monthly usage to frontend
- **Authentication**: Secure team-based access

#### **Webhook Updates** (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)
- **Usage Reset**: Calls `resetMonthlyUsage()` on upgrade
- **Triggers**: Payment success and subscription activation
